I'm a hardworking and diligent professional who's been developing software for about 5 years and learning new technologies for over  15 years. I studied at North Carolina Central University to earn a bachelor degree in Business Administration with a concentration in computer information systems. I would later go back to school and earned an AS degree in Database Technology and become an Oracle Certified Associate under the Oracle 9i track. Currently I'm working to become a Microsoft Certified Solutions Developer (MCSD). I continued to learn the latest hardware and how it affects our company products in regards to platforms and infrastructure. In addition I have worked on several projects within my employment to furhter my career as a software developer.
