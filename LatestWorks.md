### **Transportation Service Tracker**

This desktop application tracks vehicle maintenance information for a single user on their vehicle. Once an account is created the user can track oil and air filter changes, oil level, and other vehicle maintenance. The user can also view the amount of times the oil and air filter has been changed on the vehicle based on years. All services performed can be displayed on screen by the user. 

Technology Used:

I developed this application using Visual Studio 2019 Community (VB .Net). A SQL Server database in SQL Express 2008 R2 is used to host the application's data. Should install in Windows 8 or higher.

### **CC's Classic Cakes**

This web application allows customers to order cakes from an online bakery business. The customer orders are updated in a SQL Server database and sends a confirmation email to the customer once the order is placed. The business owner hosting the site has a separate login that's used to see order history for each customer. A Search of Orders based on a date range can be done to provided a printed list of how many cakes need to be made based on that date range. Customer orders can be modified and updated. The owner can also see the total orders in the system and the total profits they generate. The order items can be adjusted as well. This business owner ocassionally sales cake by the slice so there's an option to turn on an option that allows customers to purchase cake slices.
