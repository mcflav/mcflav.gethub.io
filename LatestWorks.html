           <strong><em><u>Purpose:</u></em></br>
           This web application allows customers to order cakes from an online bakery business. After placing an order the user is 
           directed to the owner’s Pay pal account to make payment for their purchase. Customer orders are updated in a SQL Server 
           database. A confirmation email is sent to the customer once the order is placed. The business owner hosting the site has a 
           separate login that’s used to see order history for each customer. A search of Orders based on a date range can be produced
           to provide a printed list of how many cakes need to be made based on that date range. Customer orders can be modified and 
           updated by the owner. The owner can also see the total orders in the system and the total profits they generate. Customer 
           payments and balances are also tracked.  The order items can be adjusted as well (new items added, items, deleted, and price
           changes to items). The business owner occasionally sales cake by the slice so there’s an option to turn on an option that 
           allows customers to purchase cake by the slice. </br></br>

           the user can track oil and air filter changes. Oil level and other vehicle maintenance services are tracked as well. The 
           user can also view the amount of times the oil and air filter have been changed on the vehicle based on year(s). All services
           performed can be displayed on screen by the user.  </br></br>
