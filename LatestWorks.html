           <strong><em><u>Transportation Service Tracker</u></strong></em></br></br>

          This desktop application tracks vehicle maintenance information for a single user on their vehicle. 
          Once an account is created the user can track oil and air filter changes, oil level, and other vehicle maintenance services.
          The user can also view the amount of times the oil and air filter has been changed on the vehicle based on years.
          All services performed can be displayed on screen by the user.</br></br>
          
          <strong><u>Technology Used:</u></strong></br></br>
          
          I developed this application using Visual Studio 2019 Community (VB .Net). A SQL Server database in SQL Express 2008 R2 is
          used to host the application's data. Thi application should be installed on a machine running Windows 8 or higher.</br></br>

          <strong><em><u>CC's Classic Cakes</strong></u></em></br></br>

          This web application allows customers to order cakes from an online bakery business. The customer orders are updated in a SQL
          Server database and sends a confirmation email to the customer once the order is placed. The business owner hosting the site
          has a separate login that's used to see order history for each customer. A Search of Orders based on a date range can be done
          to provided a printed list of how many cakes need to be made based on that date range. Customer orders can be modified and 
          updated. The owner can also see the total orders in the system and the total profits they generate. The order items can be 
          adjusted as well. This business owner ocassionally sales cake by the slice so there's an option to turn on an option that 
          allows customers to purchase cake slices. </br></br>

          I developed this site using Visual Studio 2012 C# and Artisteer 4.0. I created a SQL Server database in SQL Express 2008 R2 
          that houses the website's data. The site is deployed on a Windows 2016 server with IIS installed using Microsoft .Net 4.0.</br></br>
