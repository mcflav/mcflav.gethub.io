         <p id="career1">
           I’ve been employed in the technology industry for more than 15 years and have over 7 educational years in computer 
           information systems.  In regards to education this is an endless process for me as I continue to educate myself with the 
           latest technologies by reading, attending meetup groups, and taking online courses on topics and technologies in the field.
         </p>
         <p id="career2">  
           I’m currently a Sr. Technology Support Analyst and Lead Support Technician for our Relius Connect Web Services (APIs) and 
           Relius Administration Single Sign On products. I assist customers with access to Relius Connect API’s via setup and 
           configuration, code samples, and supply xml samples of working SoapUI calls. I also help with SSO setup (legacy and SAML 2.0)
           by providing help with configuration and sample assertions. I give technical assistance to customers who use our desktop 
           (network, standalone, terminal server) and web products. Some of my duties include assisting customers with software 
           downloads and installations, discussing supported hardware and software configurations based on different customers’ 
           infrastructure, and troubleshooting technical issues that evolve from our software during and after installation. Or Relius 
           Administration network and web products require customers to have a separate dedicated Oracle database server. I have a 
           privilege to troubleshoot customer database issues as well. I get the opportunity to work with developers on some software 
           problems that are beyond the scope of technology and are more related to coding bugs. I also handled our Relius Administration
           install builds for 2 years. I was in charge of coding the install logic and building the install files for our Relius 
           Administration Desktop and Web products. My interest and desire to continue learning software development and design never 
           expired after graduating college. I continue to educate myself on newer technologies and common programming languages so that
           my skills are maintained and effective enough to be a value to those I service.
