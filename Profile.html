         <p>
               I have been employed in the technology industry for more than 15years and have over 6 educational years in computer
               information systems. I'm currently a Technology Support Analyst . I support and give technical assistance to customers
               who use our desktop (network, standalone, terminal server) and web products. Some of my duties include assisting customers
               with software downloads and installations, discussing supported hardware and software configurations based on different
               customers' infrastructure, and troubleshooting technical issues that evolve from our software during and after 
               installation. Our Relius Administration network and web products require customers to have a separate dedicated 
               Oracle Database server. I have the privilege to troubleshoot customer database issues as well. I also work with 
               developers on some software problems that are beyond the scope of technology and are more related to coding bugs. 
               In addition I'm lead support technician to our Relius Connect web service product.

               In recent years I began my study of Object Oriented Programming and began developing applications in VB.Net and C#.
               I furthered my skills by studying ASP.Net and began developing Web Applications. I was later given an opportunity to
               work on a project for my direct manager. I developed a desktop application that automates Oracle backups for our 
               customers using RMAN. The application also configures a standby database for customers who have two oracle database servers
               and want to set up one as a standby system. I was also handled our Relius Administration install builds in which I did for
               2 years. I was in charge of coding the install logic and building the install files for our Relius Administration Desktop
               and Web products. I also built a website for my sister to assist with the recordkeeping of her baking business. 
               I'm currently working on recreating our company website. My interest and desire to continue learning software development
               and design never expired after graduating college. I continue to educate myself on newer technologies and common 
               programming languages so that my skills are maintained and effective enough to be a value to those I service.
